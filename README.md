Our goal is to build an application which creates an appropriate set of exercises/activities that the user can partake in to help reach their fitness goal. The app will consider all of the users given information and goals to provide a COVID-friendly workout routine that requires no preemptive research on the user’s end. The user will just be notified of the daily workout that they must complete. Students will be rewarded with in-app progression based on their consistency and completion of workouts. The app will know the most convenient exercise routine based on goals and current fitness state. For example, if the user is overweight and wants to lose weight, the app will recommend cardiovascular strengthening exercises.  Also if it is an especially busy day for the students and they are on a time constraint, the app will recommend a higher intensity, short time workout to meet the student’s goals. Another feature will be relative to the student’s location. If the student is near useful exercise resources, the app will recommend that they use them. For example, if the student lives close to an outdoor track, the app will consider that in their daily routine. Or if the student cannot go outside, the app will cater a completely indoor experience.
